Description:  The app is  for transforming  visible spectra to CIELAB parameters in wines. 
              The input should be a .csv file with wavelength in rows and products in columns. 
              The name of the first column should be: longdeonda. 
              The absorption spectra (380−770 nm) of all the wines  were recorded
              at constant intervals (Δλ = 1 nm) using 1 mm path length glass cells and distilled water as areference. 
              The CIELAB parameters (L*, a*, b*, C* ab , and h ab ) were determine following the recommendations of the Commission International de L’Eclariage: 26 the 10°Standard Observer and Standard Illuminant D65.
